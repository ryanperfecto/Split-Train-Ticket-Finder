<strong>Split Rail Ticket Finder</strong>

This PHP application is a method of finding the prices between routes, by specification all
of the stations in between. It could do with a tidy up and was written for myself for
one particular journey.

<strong>What is Stations.json?</strong>
stations.json is a list of train stations that have been obtained
from the wikipedia website. Inside the json is a station name, 
station postcode and station code.

<strong>What is Stations.php?</strong>
stations.php grabs all of the stations from wikipedia and puts them
into the stations.json file.
